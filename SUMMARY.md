# Fantasy Football Draft Simulator - Summary

## What Was Built

A comprehensive fantasy football draft simulator that can:

1. **Handle Keepers**: Automatically identifies and assigns keepers from the draft file
2. **Smart Drafting**: Teams prioritize filling starting positions before bench spots
3. **Progressive Randomness**: Early picks are more predictable, later picks have more randomness
4. **Position Requirements**: Ensures teams fill their complete starting roster
5. **Export Results**: Saves draft results to CSV for analysis

## Files Created

### Core Files
- `draft_simulator.py` - Main simulator class and logic
- `config.py` - Configuration settings for easy customization
- `run_multiple_simulations.py` - Script to run multiple simulations and analyze results

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Complete usage instructions
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Output
- `simulated_draft_results.csv` - Generated draft results

## Key Features

### Keeper Support
- Automatically reads keeper information from the draft CSV
- Assigns keepers to correct teams and positions
- Removes keepers from available player pool

### Smart Position Filling
- **Starting Roster**: 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 K, 1 DST
- **FLEX Position**: Can be filled by RB, WR, or TE
- **Priority System**: Teams fill starting positions before bench spots

### Progressive Randomness
- **Picks 1-10**: Top 5 players available (very predictable)
- **Picks 11-50**: Top 15 players available (moderate randomness)
- **Picks 51-100**: Top 30 players available (high randomness)
- **Picks 100+**: Top 50 players available (very high randomness)

### Weighted Selection
- Higher-ranked players have higher selection probability
- Randomness increases as draft progresses
- Maintains realistic draft behavior

## Usage Examples

### Single Simulation
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run single simulation
python draft_simulator.py
```

### Multiple Simulations
```bash
# Run 20 simulations and analyze results
python run_multiple_simulations.py
```

### Customization
Edit `config.py` to adjust:
- Randomness factors
- Pick thresholds
- Starting roster requirements
- File paths
- Output settings

## Sample Output

The simulator produces:
1. **Console Output**: Complete draft results with team rosters
2. **CSV Export**: Structured data for further analysis
3. **Statistics**: Player selection frequency across multiple simulations

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- pandas - Data manipulation
- numpy - Numerical operations
- random - Random number generation

### Data Structure
- **Available Players**: CSV with rankings, positions, and availability
- **Draft Order**: CSV with pick order and keeper information
- **Results**: Structured output with pick details and team rosters

### Algorithm
1. Initialize team rosters and identify keepers
2. For each pick:
   - Check if keeper pick
   - Calculate team needs
   - Select best available player with randomness
   - Update team roster
3. Export results

## Customization Options

### Randomness
```python
RANDOMNESS_FACTORS = {
    'early_picks': 5,      # Adjust for early pick predictability
    'mid_picks': 15,       # Adjust for middle pick randomness
    'late_picks': 30,      # Adjust for late pick randomness
    'very_late_picks': 50  # Adjust for very late pick randomness
}
```

### Roster Requirements
```python
STARTING_ROSTER = {
    'QB': 1,
    'RB': 2,
    'WR': 2,
    'TE': 1,
    'FLEX': 1,
    'K': 1,
    'DST': 1
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Team-specific drafting strategies
- Player ADP (Average Draft Position) integration
- Trade simulation
- Mock draft functionality
- Web interface
- Real-time draft tracking

## Conclusion

This simulator provides a realistic and customizable fantasy football draft experience that can help users:
- Practice draft strategies
- Analyze player value
- Understand draft dynamics
- Prepare for actual drafts

The modular design makes it easy to modify and extend for different league formats and scoring systems.
